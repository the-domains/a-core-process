### Who is Psychotherapy for?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/737fdc3c-23de-4c2f-9f0e-34061f723cd1.jpg)

Psychotherapy is for anyone who feels stuck in their current life situation.

It is an opportunity to speak with a professional practitioner in complete confidence; to voice inner feelings, share and release fears and concerns.

Core Process Psychotherapists offer a non-judgemental, safe, compassionate holding space for whatever you need to bring.

**Some of the issues explored in psychotherapy**

...Anxiety and recurring fears  
...Low mood, anger and fear of emotions  
...Self-limiting patterns that keep repeating  
...Knowing you could be more and yet feel stuck  
...Anger at past events which hijack present and future  
...Difficulties in relationships  
...Overcoming traumatic life events  
...Discovering ways to reduce and manage stress  
...Finding and expressing inner creativity  
...At a crossroads or turning point? Explore options.

Whatever is troubling you, and if it is causing ongoing anxiety and sleeplessness, please reach out to someone who you feel you can trust. A trained independent professional person, may be your best option. Contact the Samaritans on

**What happens in a session?**  
The Core Process Psychotherapist helps bring awareness to what is happening in the present moment. She supports and encourages you to open to your experience as it arises in the moment, in real time.

Core Process Psychotherapy is a mindfulness-based psychotherapy, but it is the psychotherapist who works mindfully and non-judgementally.

You will be guided and supported as your process unfolds. The Core Process Psychotherapist will help reveal the core issues underlying your current problems. At the same time she will help you discover and identify resources to support you to stay grounded and open.

Psychotherapeutic work is based on the quality of the relationship between the client and psychotherapist. The more honest and open you are , the more effective the therapy will be.

Core Process Psychotherapy works deeply and requires commitment. Both brief and long term psychotherapy are available. It is best to agree a length of time at the outset so that both client and psychotherapist can work within the timeline set.

**How long is each session?**  
Sessions are for one hour and usually take place weekly at the same time. I offer six sessions followed by a review session. The Review session is a space for you to reflect on how the sessions are going and for me to feedback key considerations in our work together.

**Fee**  
Current standard fee is Â£45.00 per session. There may be a concessionary place available, please ask.

**Practice Location**  
I practise in Edinburgh and the Scottish Borders.   
My practice is located in the Tara Trust building at 12 Marchhall Crescent, Edinburgh EH16 5HL and at The Meeting House, Abbey Row, Kelso, TD5 7JF in the Scottish Borders.
