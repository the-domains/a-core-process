**Courses and Training in Core Process Psychotherapy**

Core Process Psychotherapy, was was founded by Maura Sills and established in 1982 at the Karuna Institute in Devon. It is one of the original mindfulness-based psychotherapy training programs. 

Core Process Psychotherapy draws on Buddhist psychology and mindfulness practice integrated with western personality theory, psychodynamics and psychotherapy skills. 

Core Process Psychotherapists are required to have a regular and ongoing personal mindfulness practice. 

The Core Process Psychotherapist does not teach mindfulness practices to their clients but rather clients are oriented to mindfulness through dialogue and the Core Process Psychotherapist's particular skilful approach to enquiry.  
Training in Core Process Psychotherapy is offered at the Karuna Institute in Devon and foundations courses are offered in London, the South West and Scotland. See www.karuna-institute.co.uk
