Core Process Psychotherapy is a mindfulness-based psycho dynamic approach to psychotherapy.

It is based on a depth awareness of the moment to moment arising experience in the relationship between client and psychotherapist. 

The Core Process Psychotherapist can help you identify unhealthy patterns laid down in the past and support you to bring them into conscious awareness as they manifest in the present. 

The Core Process approach recognises our inherent capacity to heal and works in harmony with this.

The Core Process Psychotherapist brings attention in a particular way to what is here in the present moment, awaiting recognition.

A non invasive approach, the Core Process psychotherapist works at depth to help uncover what lies beneath current problems.

Difficulties are not seen as necessarily negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation and areas for growth.

Difficulties and painful edges conceal the unlived parts of ourselves that await recognition and expression.
