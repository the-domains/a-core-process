Core Process Psychotherapy works in harmony with our inherent capacity to heal.  
The Core Process Psychotherapist brings attention in a particular way to what is here in the present moment, awaiting recognition.

A non invasive approach, it works at depth to help uncover what lies beneath current problems.  
Difficulties are not seen as negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation and areas for growth.

Difficulties and painful edges conceal the unlived parts of us that seek recognition and expression.
