### What is Core Process Psychotherapy?

Core Process Psychotherapy was established around 25 years ago in Devon, England at the Karuna Institute by its founder and director, Maura Sills. 

As one of the original mindfulness-based psychotherapies it recognises Western psychological theories and the science and art of Mindfulness.

Core Process Psychotherapists are trained in a particular way to cultivate awareness of presence at depth. This generates a non-invasive, open, compassionate and safe space space in which the client can bring their deepest fears, wants and needs.

Core Process Psychotherapy is based on the premise that the 'core' or blueprint of our being is always in a state of complete health.

This is an aspect of 'self' which is constant, pre-existing and complete. It is the 'hidden treasure' of our being which can only be realised through the act of conscious awareness.

The Core Process Psychotherapist is trained to support depth awareness and presence in relationship. And therapist and client work together to reveal and identify patterns of past conditioning.

The Core Process Psychotherapist cultivates a relationship founded on compassion, clarity and spaciousness and works in a particular way with what awaits recognition,

Difficulties are not seen as necessarily negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation and areas for growth.

Our psychological and emotional pain carry the unlived parts of ourselves that await recognition and expression of our full potential.
