Core Process Psychotherapy is a mindfulness-based psychodynamic approach to psychotherapy.

A non invasive approach, the Core Process psychotherapist works at depth to help uncover what lies beneath current problems.

Core Process is based on the premise that at the 'core' or blueprint of our being, there is always a state of complete health. 

This essential 'self' is constant, pre-existing and complete. It is the 'hidden treasure' of our being which is realised through the act of our conscious awareness.

The Core Process Psychotherapist supports the depth awareness of present moment unfolding experience in the relationship between client and psychotherapist.

Core Process Psychotherapy helps reveal and identify the unhealthy patterns laid down in the past which obscure our inherent health. 

The Core Process Psychotherapist will support you to bring these into conscious awareness, bringing attention in a particular way to what is here in the present moment, awaiting recognition.

Difficulties are not seen as necessarily negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation and areas for growth.

Enfolded in psychological and emotional pain are the unlived parts of ourselves that await recognition and expression.
