Core Process Psychotherapy works in harmony with our inherent capacity to heal.  
The Core Process Psychotherapist brings attention in a particular way to what is here in the present moment, awaiting recognition.

A non invasive approach, the Core Process psychotherapist works at depth to help uncover what lies beneath current problems.

Difficulties are not seen as necessarily negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation and areas for growth.

Difficulties and painful edges conceal the unlived parts of ourselves that await recognition and expression.
