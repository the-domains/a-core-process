Mindfulness-based Core Process Psychotherapy is a psychodynamic approach to psychotherapy.

It is a non invasive approach yet the Core Process Psychotherapist works at depth to help uncover what lies beneath current problems.

Core Process is based on the premise that the 'core' or blueprint of our being is always in a state of complete health.

This essential 'self' is constant, pre-existing and complete. It is the 'hidden treasure' of our being which can be realised through the act of conscious awareness.

The Core Process Psychotherapist is trained to support depth awareness and presence in relationship. Therapist and client work together to reveal and identify the unhealthy patterns of past conditioning.

The Core Process Psychotherapist will support you to bring these into conscious awareness, by sustaining attention in a particular way to what awaits recognition.

Difficulties are not seen as necessarily negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation and areas for growth.

Enfolded within psychological and emotional pain are the unlived parts of ourselves that await recognition and expression.
