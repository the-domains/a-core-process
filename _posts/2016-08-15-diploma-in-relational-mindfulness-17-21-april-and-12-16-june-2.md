17-21 April & 12-16 June 2017 in Edinburgh  
Tutor - Maura Sills, founder and Director of the Karuna Institute

This two-part Diploma course is intended to give a preliminary grounding in the basic theory and practice of mindfulness in psychotherapeutic practice.

Participants are introduced to key therapeutic contemplative approaches and relational skills, grounded in the practice of Core Process Psychotherapy (one of the original mindfulness-based therapeutic forms).

By adapting ancient Buddhist mindfulness practices for working jointly in relationship, this approach invites us to listen at depth to self, other and the relational field.

In Core Process Psychotherapy, Eastern and Western theories of being and selfhood are integrated with the intention to understand and alleviate the suffering that emerges from our conditional self-forms.

This course is open to anyone with a desire to deepen their awareness and experience of relational presence. It is ideally suited to counsellors, psychotherapists, those employed in the Health & Social Care professions, Mindfulness Trainers, Teachers, Life Coaches, Mediators and Mentors.
